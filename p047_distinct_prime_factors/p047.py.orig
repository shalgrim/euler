The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:

Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors.

    # took 2:52 with method2
    # took 3:44 with method1, was only 3:07 before I "fixed" it
    # I fixed it again and now it took 3:22 just to get to n = 10000

    # Then I added method 3 and that takes 10 times longer (NUM_PRIME_FACTORS
    #  = 3) then method 2, which is amazeballs

    # ... maybe do profiling now
    # alternatively do something where you cache known primes as generating
    # those may be part of the problem
    # so could do some profiling to look at that

<<<<<<< HEAD
    # I did some profiling and the single biggest time suck is
    # PrimeChecker._is_prime at 85 seconds

    # Ima profile method 2, which the last time took 3:20, but I had
    # debugging prints in there
    # results of that are that I spent almost all of my time, over three
    # minutes, in _is_prime

    # Well I tried to fix that and now that's taking forever (not sure it's
    # ever going to finish)
    # I think the problem is going to be in prime generator generating the
    # same primes over and over again
    # So the solution is going to be to cache known primes higher up in the
    # solution
=======
    # 5/30/15
    # just checked out this revision (d60a8278) and it takes 3:07 with method 1
    # and 2:52 with method 2 so this is a good place to start over since I'd
    # managed to make everything run slower in my changes after this

    # So let's profile method2 again
    # It says it's spending 165 seconds in _is_prime
    # Let's make my first change changing range to xrange in that method

    # That took it down to 72 seconds
    # And it's still spending 64 seconds of that in _is_prime

    # And then I got it by reworking _is_prime to keep track of a "starting
    # point" of numbers where we don't know whether it's prime or not to
    # start from instead of starting from 2 every time. it runs in 30 seconds
