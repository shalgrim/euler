"""
There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:

123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345

In combinatorics, we use the notation, 5 choose 3 = 10.

In general,
n choose 4 = n!/(r!(n-r)!) ,
where r <= n, n! = n x (n-1) x ... x 3 x 2 x 1, and 0! = 1.

It is not until n = 23, that a value exceeds one-million:
23 choose 10 = 1144066.

How many, not necessarily distinct, values of n choose r, for 1 <= n <= 100, are
greater than one-million?
